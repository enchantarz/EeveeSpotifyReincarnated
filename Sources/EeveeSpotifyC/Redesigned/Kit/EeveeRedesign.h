// The flags the redesign is built on. A redesigned screen, and the glass design Spotify ships switched

// rows need the list to lock theirs. Only while Redesigned UI was on at launch is anything forced,
// and then over an override from the All flags page too (Core/EeveeFlagForce.h). The switch itself is
// Core/EeveeUIMode.h's.
// Threading: register from a %ctor, before Spotify reads a flag.
