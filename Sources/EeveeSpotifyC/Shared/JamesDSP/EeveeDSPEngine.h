// JamesDSP's engine, libjamesdsp (vendor/libjamesdsp), made fit for Core Audio's render thread: one per
// process, fed the finished output a slice at a time, whatever size the slice.
//
// libjamesdsp wants a fixed block: every change of the frame count reallocates its buffers and rebuilds
// its convolutions (pfloat32 -> JamesDSPRefreshConvolutions), and iOS hands the output unit 1024 frames,
// 4096 with the screen locked, sometimes an odd count. So the engine re-blocks: frames go into a block of
// kEeveeDSPEngineBlock, a full block is processed, and the processed frames come out of a FIFO primed with one
// block of silence. The sound is always exactly one block later than it went in (21 ms at 48 kHz),
// whatever the slices.
//
// libjamesdsp's setters are mostly not safe against processing, so every setter here takes the engine's
// lock, and the render thread only tries it: a block that finds it taken passes through unprocessed, one
// block late all the same, so nothing jumps while a setting changes.
//
// Threading: EeveeDSPEngineProcess runs on the render thread and never allocates, blocks, logs or messages
// (libjamesdsp takes a mutex of its own around three effects there, which only this lock's holder can
// hold, so it never waits). EeveeDSPEngineRestart and the diagnostics are for any thread. Everything else is
// the config side: one thread at a time, never the render thread. Plain C; compiles on the Mac as is
// (harness/jamesdsp).
